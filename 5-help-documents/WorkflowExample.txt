To understand the CI/CD example system in this repository, let’s walk through each step of the CI/CD development process together.

Note that in this proposed CI/CD system, the below two roles have the following manual steps:
Senior engineer:      Checks off on development engineer's work, approving merges. Has to manaully merge the pull requests from dev to release branches.
                      Once ready, can merge release to main in order to trigger the continuous deployment pipeline. (Responsible for steps 14 & 15.)
Development engineer: The only manual steps this role should take is the development of Studio 5000 Logix Designer application code
                      and making the git commits to kick of the continuous integration pipeline. (Responsbile for steps 3 to 8.)

Step 1:	 Fork this repo at https://github.com/RockwellAutomation/ra-cicd-example.git.
Step 2:  Create a feature branch called 'develop/datatype-bounds' and a release branch called 'release/v1.0.0', both from the 'main' branch.
Step 3:	 Clone the new forked repo to local instance using the below command in a command prompt:
         'git clone <insert your repo link here>'
Step 4:	 Checkout develop/datatype-bounds branch using the below command in a command prompt:
         'git checkout develop/datatype-bounds'
Step 5:  This step is redundant at the moment but will be useful to establish a workflow in future steps. Run the below command to update the local repository 
         with the remote repository:
         'git pull'
Step 6:	 Let’s develop an application in Studio 5000® Logix. Using the File Explorer, open the L5X file at 
         “<your_local_repo_filepath>\1-PRODUCTION-files\L5Xs\ExampleWithCICD_L85E.L5X”. 
         Note that you will be prompted to open the file as an ACD. Click through and open the ACD project at some local instance of your development environment. 
Step 7:	 Familiarize yourself with the project. Then, change some component of the project logic. 
         This change will be tested in the upcoming steps.
Step 8:	 'Save As' the project as an L5X file, saving the file with the same name at the “<your_local_repo_filepath>\1-PRODUCTION-files\L5Xs\" folder.
         Note that you will have to overwrite the existing file. That is ok.
Step 9:	 Let’s make a git commit. Note that every team has different commenting conventions. There are no definitive rules but consistency across the 
         team is a good rule of thumb. Run the following three commands one after another from the command prompt:
         'git add .'
         'git commit -m “Make first commit!”'  
         'git push origin develop/datatype-bounds'
Step 10: Note that the now updated develop/datatype-bounds branch triggers the RA-EXAMPLE-CI pipeline in Jenkins. Open Jenkins by navigating to your browser 
         and search 'http://localhost:8080/' in the search bar. This should pull up the Jenkins login screen.
Step 11: Sign into Jenkins.
Step 12: Click into the RA-EXAMPLE-CI pipeline. Navigate to the settings and update the two instances with your forked repositorie's git url.
         For its first execution, you may need to manually run the Jenkins pipeline. If the RA-EXAMPLE-CI pipeline hasn't started yet, click 'Build Now'.
Step 13: To watch the RA-EXAMPLE-CI pipeline execute, click the button to the direct left of the build # under the 'Build History' panel on the left side of 
         the screen. Note the various stages of the Jenkins pipeline and the console outputs from the test scripts. (If running into issues here, navigate to 
         the troubleshooting section below.)
Step 14: If the CI pipeline did not pass all unit tests, note the console outputs specifying the location where email notifications could be configured to notify 
         engineers of a test failure. Then, return to Step 6 and follow each step back to this one to correct the change made to the project that is flagging one 
         of the test cases. If this had been a manufacturing enviornment, note that the CI testing just caught a mistake that could have cost time and money!
         If the CI pipeline passes all tests, you should see that a pull request has been programmatically created in your forked repository.
Step 15: Navigate to your web broswer and open up your remote GitHub repository. Click the 'Pull requests' tab at the top of the screen, click into the newly 
         opened pull request, and click 'Merge pull request'. Then click 'Merge'. Then Delete the release/pending-pr-## branch.
         We've now updated the release/v1.0.0 branch. If you would like to keep testing the CI pipeline, navigate back to Step 5 and keep making application 
         modifications until ready to continue.
Step 16: Navigate to your web broswer and open up your remote GitHub repository. Click the 'Pull requests' tab at the top of the screen, and click 
         'New pull request'. Merge the release/v1.0.0 into the main branch to trigger the RA-EXAMPLE-CD pipeline.
Step 17: Navigate back to Jenkins and open the RA-EXAMPLE-CD pipeline. For its first execution, you may need to manually run the Jenkins pipeline; if the 
         RA-EXAMPLE-CD pipeline hadn't started yet, click 'Build Now'. Note the various stages of the Jenkins pipeline and the console outputs from the test 
         scripts. (If running into issues here, navigate to the troubleshooting section below.)

Congradulations! You’ve completed a basic CI/CD workflow to develop a Studio 5000 Logix Designer application!


Troubleshooting | Misc Suggestions
-   If looking to test using a Jenkins user run command prompt, run the below command:
    'runas /user:Jenkins cmd' or 'runas /user:Jenkins powershell'
-   If the GitHub client needs to be installed, run the below two commands one by one in a Jenkins command prompt/powershell:
    'winget install --id GitHub.cli'
    'gh auth login'
-   If running into GitHub permissions issues, check to see if your repository is private. If so, establish proper connections using your personal acces token.
    Try executing the below command if you have a personal acces token:
    git remote set-url origin "https://<insert_github_username>:<insert_github_pers_acc_token>@github.com/<insert_github_username/<insert_github_repo_name>.git"
-   If running into a 'schannel: failed to receive handshake, SSL/TLS connection failed' error, try running the below command:
    'git config --global http.sslBackend schannel'
-   Note that if trying to make a git commit, Studio 5000 Logix Designer (and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 if developing a C# script) must be closed.


Limitations | The unit test scripts only suport:
-   Only Add-On Instruction definition L5X & Full Application L5X files are valid unit test target objects.
-   Only atomic data types BOOL, SINT, INT, DINT, LINT, REAL, and STRING are currently supported.
-   Add-On Instruction definition testing excludes InOut parameters.
-   Can’t change the order in which input tag/parameters are set; all input values are set from top to bottom in the order they were provided in the input excel worksheet.
-   Full application testing does not support time-based testing unless it is built into the logic of a controller (no clock cycle).
